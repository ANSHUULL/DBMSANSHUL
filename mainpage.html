                SQL (Structured Query Language):

                SQL, often pronounced as "sequel," is a standard programming language designed for managing and
                manipulating
                data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It provides a set of commands for performing
                tasks
                such as querying data, updating data, inserting new records, and deleting records from a database.
                SQL is
                used to interact with databases to retrieve and manipulate data stored in tables.
